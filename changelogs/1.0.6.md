## TenorJS v1.0.6

### 1. Native Operations
When I first released TenorJS, I made it clear in the code snippets of the *Usage & Guides* examples that there were certain operations I will probably have the wrapper perform natively to spare developers the inconvenience of dealing with them. Let's take a look at what has improved since then!

1. **Native date formatting:**
Tenor's API, when you make a request of it that pertains to a GIF, returns a number of very useful information; however, when it comes to the GIF's creation date, it returns a UNIX timestamp that a developer then has to make another step to format. **--** Personally, I wasn't a fan of it and considered it bad UX, so I did something about it.

Prior to returning the requested information to the developer, TenorJS intercepts it and makes some modifications pertaining to dates.

**1-** TenorJS automatically formats the UNIX timestamp into human readable dates, like such: `14/10/2015 - 1:08:25 AM` and pushes the change back into the JSON response.

**2-** To ensure the UNIX timestamp is still there for anyone that wants to make use of it, TenorJS does re-insert the original timestamp back into the JSON response under the `created_stamp` object.

Please note that date formatting is handled by [moment](https://npmjs.com/package/moment).

2. **Native GIF title checking:**
Another thing I noticed about JSON responses was that when the GIF had no title, the `title` object would be returned blank. Again, I wasn't a personal fan of this so I dedcided to do something about it.

In v1.0.6, TenorJS now automatically checks the `title` object upon receiving a response and gives it a value of "Untitled" if it turned out to be blank.
